Information-Influence-Disinformation-Analysis
Analysis of information campaigns conducted by state and proxy actors across the EU. I have observed it between 2015-2022 although narratives are still the same - to bring chaos into EU structures and divide countries. My russian language skills are the key in mentioned topic.

📝 Sample Case Study
Scenario
A fictional information campaigns targeting EU institutions or polish citizens

Observations
📈 Increased activity on certain topics (e.g Polish armed forces ale completely uncapable to protect own citizens; ukraine is the enemy; deliberately exploiting the heuristic errors that we often make.)
🖼️ Consistent framing
🔁 Repetition of key messaging
(a lot of fake accounts that spread narrative into social media, especially X, earlier whatsapp and Facebook, appealing to a supposed authority, such as a professor or expert, taking statements of famous politicians out of context)
Conclusions
The campaign aimed to undermine public trust, fear of support e.g Ukraine, to create a false sense that it is better to live in harmony with Russia than to oppose it.

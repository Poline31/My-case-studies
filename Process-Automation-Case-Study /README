Ticket Quality Assessment Automation

⚠️ Problem
Manual ticket quality assessment was:

⏳ time-consuming
🤔 subjective
🔄 inconsistent across analysts
💡 Solution
I created an Excel spreadsheet that:

📥 aggregates data from ServiceNow tickets
🧹 normalizes fields
✅ automatically evaluates team performance (priority, categories, rule names and descriptions, closure reasons)
🛠️ Technologies
📊 Excel (pivot tables, formulas,Power Query)
🧮 scoring logic
📈 quality metrics
